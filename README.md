## About the Video Course
Spring 5.0 is due to arrive with a myriad of new and exciting features that will change the way we’ve used the framework so far. This video will show you this evolution—from solving the problems of testable applications to building distributed applications on the cloud. The video begins with an insight into the new features in Spring 5.0 and shows you how to build an application using Spring MVC. You will realize how application architectures have evolved from monoliths to those built around microservices. You will then get a thorough understanding of how to build and extend microservices using Spring Boot. You will also understand how to build and deploy Cloud-Native microservices with Spring Cloud. The advanced features of Spring Boot will be illustrated through powerful examples. We will be introduced to a JVM language that’s quickly gaining popularity - Kotlin. Also, we will discuss how to set up a Kotlin project in Eclipse. By the end of the video, you will be equipped with the knowledge and best practices required to develop microservices with the Spring Framework.
